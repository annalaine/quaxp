Here, they will be handled with the same algorithm, only the function used and the way of measuring the performance change. We use a simple K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for both types of prediction tasks. The KNN algorithm is simple to understand and to implement and usually gives good results, that is why we chose it for this course."

    "The KNN algorithm classifies a new instance based on the idea that \"similar objects are close to each other\". The ground idea of the algorithm is to calculate a distance metrics between each instance, and to classify similarly two instances that are close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this in details, with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to classify some types of flowers: we have 3 classes or iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica). We have the petal length and width for a few samples of each flower, represented on this graph:\n",

    "To classify an instance, the KNN algorithm measures the distance of the instance to every other instance in the training dataset. Then, according to the value of ``K`` (a parameter of the model that has to be specified by the user), the algorithm then looks at the class of the ``K`` instances with the smaller distance to the new instance. The majority class among the K nearest instances is the class that is predicted for the new algorithm. Let's look together at a small example:\n",

    "In black, a new instance has been represented: we do not know the class of this instance and want the algorithm to predict it. The model will first find the nearest K instances (in this example, we took ``K = 5``):\n",

    "The algorithm now will look at the class of these K instances. In our example, we have 3 points of the class Iris-versicolor (orange) and 2 of the class Iris-virginica (green): the majority class of the K nearest neighbors is then Iris-versicolor, and the instance is classified as such.\n",
    "\n",
