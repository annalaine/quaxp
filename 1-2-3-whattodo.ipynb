    "In general, there are 3 ways of dealing with missing values:\n",
    "+ __recover the value__: sometimes, it is possible to recover the value, either by guessing or predicting with another machine learning algorithm. For example, for a broader task where we would use the attribute length and width for prediction: we can predict the missing width from the length attribute, with a good model (like the one we built in this course, for example).\n",
    "+ __set up a constant value__: just like we filled the missing values with zeros, it is possible to set up any constant value for the missing values. This works best if the attribute containing the missing values is not the only one used in the model, and a change of it would not change too much the task we want to solve. For example, taking the mean of the series, or the median value, could work.\n",
    "+ __drop the columns or the rows containing missing values__: if an attributes has way too many missing values, it can make sense to just ignore it, and not include it in the model we build. On the other hands, if some rows contain missing values for a lot of different attributes, it can make sense to drop them."
