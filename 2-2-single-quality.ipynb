    "In this course, we are looking at the general meaning of \"data quality\". For a machine learning experiment, it makes sense to study the global quality of a whole dataset, and this can differ from the quality of single instances. However, for images, we believe it is important to understand and be able to gauge the quality of a single image in order to understand the bigger picture.\n",
